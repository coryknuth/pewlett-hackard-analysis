# Pewlett Hackard Retirement Planning

Pewlett Hackard asked us to take a close look at the employee database and see what the extent of an impending wave of retirements is, and try and determine some of the key next steps for the company. This analysis will break down our findings regarding how many employees are set to potentially retire in the near future, from which departments they would retire, and some potential options for the company to cover and fill these losses.

## Findings

- There are over 90,000 employees eligible for retirement in the near future
- Nearly 60,000 of those are Senior Staff or Senior Engineers

- Almost 50,000 of those soon retiring are skilled technical positions
- We compiled a list of 1,500 employees who would be suitable mentors for new incoming employees

## Summary

The potential loss to retirment is extremely significant as you can see, we are set to lose tens of thousands of key senior and technical employees over the next handful of years and we reccomend acting quickly to hire and train new employees as well as filling leadership roles from within. We also found some key information about management team losses in the short term. Our analysis identified 6 current department managers who could retire in the near future, 2 of those 6 being the very near future.

It is critical that we begin the process now of identifying who the candidates for replacement dept leads could be. We identified a list of the most senior members of each department to be considered for replacements if their department manager should retire. Here is the first 15 of that list.

We also believe it is critical to begin choosing the employees from the mentorship candidates list who would become the trainers for incoming employees as soon as possible. In conjunction with beginning the hiring process immediately.
